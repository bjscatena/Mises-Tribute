            <span class="big-initial-letter">L</span>udwig von Mises was a
            famous Austrian economist and was one of the most notable
            philosophers of the 20th century. During the course of his long and
            fertile career, he developed a cohesive, inferential science of
            economics grounded on the central adage that human beings act
            purposively to accomplish preferred ends. Through his countless
            studies and research, he concluded that the only feasible economic
            policy for mankind was by means of ‘laissez-faire’. His writings
            were dominated by theories pertaining to epistemology, economics,
            history, politics and philosophy. He was the first scholar to
            identify that economics is part of a larger science in human action,
            a science that he termed ‘praxeology’. After he moved to the United
            States, he had a significant influence over the libertarian movement
            there. During his lifetime, he was part of a number of organizations
            including the ‘Liberty Fund’, the ‘Reason Foundation’, ‘The
            Independent Institute’, ‘Foundation for Economic Education’ and the
            ‘Cato Institute’. He went on to become one of the most prominent
            influences for personalities like Israel Kirzner, Ludwig Lachmann
            and Hans-Hermann Hoppe, who were all members of the ‘Austrian
            School’ of thought, much like Mises was.
