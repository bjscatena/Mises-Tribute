          <span class="big-initial-letter">L</span>udwig von Mises was a famous
          Austrian economist and was one of the most notable philosophers of the
          20th century. During the course of his long and fertile career, he
          developed a cohesive, inferential science of economics grounded on the
          central adage that human beings act purposively to accomplish
          preferred ends. Through his countless studies and research, he
          concluded that the only feasible economic policy for mankind was by
          means of ‘laissez-faire’. His writings were dominated by theories
          pertaining to epistemology, economics, history, politics and
          philosophy. He was the first scholar to identify that economics is
          part of a larger science in human action, a science that he termed
          ‘praxeology’. After he moved to the United States, he had a
          significant influence over the libertarian movement there. During his
          lifetime, he was part of a number of organizations including the
          ‘Liberty Fund’, the ‘Reason Foundation’, ‘The Independent Institute’,
          ‘Foundation for Economic Education’ and the ‘Cato Institute’. He went
          on to become one of the most prominent influences for personalities
          like Israel Kirzner, Ludwig Lachmann and Hans-Hermann Hoppe, who were
          all members of the ‘Austrian School’ of thought, much like Mises was.
